Developed chatbot project using python for codealpha internship
Chatbot Project in Python
Overview
This is a Python-based chatbot that simulates conversations with users. The chatbot uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to process user input, understand the context, and generate appropriate responses. It supports both predefined and dynamic conversations, making it a versatile solution for user interaction. The chatbot can be integrated into applications to provide customer support, FAQs, and more.

Features
NLP-based Response Generation: Utilizes NLP techniques to parse user input and generate meaningful responses.
Predefined Responses: Can respond to specific, pre-configured questions.
Dynamic Conversations: Uses machine learning models for generating responses when context-based conversation is needed.
Simple Text Interface: The chatbot communicates via a command-line interface, making it easy to interact with.
Basic Memory: Can remember the userâ€™s name and other simple context-based information during the session.
Integration with APIs: (Optional) It can fetch live information like weather, news, or other data from third-party APIs.
Requirements
Python 3.x
nltk library (for NLP functionalities)
tensorflow or transformers library (for advanced models like GPT, BERT, or other pre-trained models)
flask or django (for integrating the chatbot into web applications, optional)
You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
pip install nltk tensorflow flask
For pre-trained models from Hugging Face:

bash
Copy
pip install transformers
Installation
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy
cd chatbot-project
Install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
You are now ready to run the chatbot application.

How to Use
Run the Chatbot:

Open your terminal, and run the chatbot by executing:

bash
Copy
python chatbot.py
Interact with the Chatbot:

Once the program starts, the chatbot will greet the user and begin asking for input. You can type questions or statements, and the chatbot will respond.

Exit: You can end the conversation by typing exit or quit.
